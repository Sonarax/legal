Disclosure of Information and Transfer of Data:
Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we reasonably attempt to ensure that we never intentionally disclose any of your Personal Information, to any third party without having received your permission, except as provided for herein or otherwise as permitted or required under law.
Third parties may be given access to your Personal Information when it is necessary to provide you with the services you requested to receive, or when such third parties are required to perform tasks on our behalf. We may share your Personal Information with our affiliates, subsidiaries or any third party companies and individuals to facilitate our services or any portion thereof, such as marketing, data management or maintenance services. We may also share your information with analytics service providers for analytics services such as Google Analytics. Google Analytics set their own cookies or other identifiers on your computer, through which they can collect information about your usage of our App. This helps us compile aggregated statistics about the effectiveness of our App and products. 
The above mentioned third parties may be located in countries other than your own, and we may send them information we receive. When such third parties process your Personal Information on our behalf, we will assure that they comply with obligations similar to those which are set forth in this Privacy Policy. We will also assure that they will abide by our data privacy and security requirements, and will be allowed to use the Personal Information solely for the purposes we set. We will transfer your Personal Information while using appropriate and suitable safeguards, while using a variety of legal mechanisms, including contracts, to ensure your rights and protections travel with your data. 
We may also transfer your information, including Personal Information, in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, the sale of related assets or corporate division or other fundamental corporate changes. Furthermore, information about you may also be released in order to comply with any valid legal inquiry or process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute or court order. We will also release specific information in special cases, such as if you use the App to perform an unlawful act or omission or take any act or omission that may damage Sonarax, its property and goodwill, or if there is an attempted breach of the security of the App or a physical or property threat to you or others. The authority supervising such activities is the Israeli Privacy Protection Authority, and you have the right to file a complaint to it or any other relevant supervisory authority.

Data Security:
We deploy industry standard, or better measures to ensure the security, confidentiality, integrity and availability of personal data we process.

California Online Privacy Protection Act:
CalOPPA requires commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers, to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf. 
According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:
- Once this Privacy Policy is created, we will add a link to it on the first significant page after entering our App.
- Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the App. 
- You can request to change your Personal Information by emailing us or by logging in to your account.

CAN SPAM Act:
The CAN-SPAM Act is a Federal US law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.
To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:
- Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.
- Identify the commercial message sent to you as an advertisement when required. 
- Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.
- Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.
- Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.
- Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email.
If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can email us at contact@sonarax.com and we will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.

Children's Privacy:
The App is not intended for children under the age of 16. We do not, knowingly or intentionally, collect information about children who are under 16 years of age. 
IF YOU ARE UNDER THE AGE OF 16 YOU MAY NOT USE THE APP, UNLESS PARENTAL CONSENT IS PROVIDED ACCORDINGLY

This Privacy Policy will be governed and interpreted pursuant to the laws of the State of Israel without giving effect to its choice of law rules. You expressly agree that the exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or action arising out of or relating to this Privacy Policy shall be to the competent courts in Tel Aviv, Israel, to the exclusion of any other jurisdiction.
